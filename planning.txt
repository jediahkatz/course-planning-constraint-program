> feature: change course requests to semester requirements

> feature: reate a better system for double counting (+ reqs that can always double count)
list of example rules on double counting:
# college
- can double count at most one course per major with the sector requirement
- majors in (set S of majors) can double count two courses in major with two specific sectors
- double majors must have 18 unique courses between the two majors (24 for triple majors)
- can count unlimited courses between gen ed and minor
- can count unlimited courses between foundational approach and (major, minor, sector)
- can count one course between two majors
- can double count at most 4 courses between submat and undergrad
# eng
- can count at most two courses for minor with courses specified on course planning guide
- must take at least 22 eng courses to double major
- can double count at most 3 courses between submat and undergrad
- no course can be triple counted
# wharton
- can always double count free electives with concentration, but can count at most one business breadth 

then major_requirements becomes requirement_blocks = [CIS_BSE, CIS_MSE, SEAS_DEPTH, SEAS_WRIT, SEAS_ETHICS]
then we have Curriculum = { requirement_blocks, double_count_matrix }
double_count_matrix[block1_idx][block2_idx] = max number of courses that can double count between the two blocks

that would get us everything except:
- no course can be triple counted
- majors in (set S of majors) can double count two courses in major with two specific sectors
- must take at least 22 eng courses to double major

we should directly enforce no triple counting; in fact we should enforce it globally to
make thing nicer
the other two we can ignore for now
